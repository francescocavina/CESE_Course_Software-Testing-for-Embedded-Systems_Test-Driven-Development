 * DRIVER TESTS:
 *
 * 01) When starting the driver, all LEDs should be off.
 * 02) With all LEDs off, it must be possible to turn on a certain LED.
 * 03) It must be possible to turn off a lit LED.
 * 04) It must be possible to turn an LED on and off with some LEDs already on and others already
 * off. 05) It must be possible to query the status of a lit LED. 06) It must be possible to query
 * the status of an off LED. 07) With all LEDs off, it must be possible to turn on all LEDs
 * together. 08) With all LEDs on, it must be possible to turn off all LEDs together. 09) It must be
 * possible to switch LEDs 1 and 16 on and off and to check that they have been switched on and off
 * respectively. 10) LEDs should not be turned on or off if the indicated LED number is outside the
 * limits (must be between 1 and 16).
